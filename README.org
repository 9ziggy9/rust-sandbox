* Reading through "The Book"
Just trying to learn Rust.
** Chapter 1
Recap:
*** We can create a project using
#+BEGIN_SRC console
cargo new
#+END_SRC
*** We can build a project using
#+BEGIN_SRC console
cargo build
#+END_SRC
*** We can build and run in one step using
#+BEGIN_SRC console
cargo run
#+END_SRC

*** We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using
#+BEGIN_SRC console
cargo check
#+END_SRC

*** Cargo stores build in the target/debug directory
